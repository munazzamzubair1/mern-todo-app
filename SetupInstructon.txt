## **Setup Instructions**  

### **1. Install Dependencies**  
1. Clone or download the project repository.  
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root project directory.  
   - **The project contains two folders:** `frontend` and `backend`.  
3. Run the following commands:  
   - **Frontend Setup:**  
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```  
   - **Backend Setup:**  
     ```bash
     cd ../backend
     npm install
     ```  

### **2. Run the Application**  
You have two options to start the app:  

#### **Option 1: Concurrently Run Both Frontend and Backend**  
From the `frontend` directory, use the following command:  
```bash
npm run start:both
```  
> This uses the `concurrently` package to launch both servers simultaneously.  

#### **Option 2: Run Separately**  
- **Frontend:**  
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm start
  ```  
- **Backend:**  
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm run dev
  ```  
Alternatively, you can run the backend server with nodemon:  
```bash
nodemon ./src/routes/index.js
```  

### **3. Database Setup**  
- Open your MongoDB client.  
- Create a new database called `todo`.  

### **4. Access the Application**  
- Launch the React frontend:  
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```  
- Open your browser and visit:  
  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
